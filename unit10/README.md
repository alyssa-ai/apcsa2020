# Unit 10 - Recursion

This unit introduces the concept of recursion – defining a process in terms of itself. In practice, this means writing methods which contain calls to themselves to solve a problem.

## Duration
* 3 Weeks

## Unit Topics
* Recursion
* Recursive functions
* Binary search
* Merge sort

## Lessons
* [Unit 10: Lesson 1 - Intro to Recursion:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit10/lesson1) This lesson introduces recursive methods, which are methods that call themselves (CON).
* [Unit 10: Lesson 2 - Recursive Functions with Returns:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit10/lesson2) This lesson demonstrates how values can be returned by recursive methods (CON).
* [Unit 10: Lesson 3 - Binary Search:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit10/lesson3) This lesson explains how a binary search algorithm finds a value in an ordered data set (CON).
* [Unit 10: Lesson 4 - Merge Sort:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit10/lesson4) This lesson covers the merge sort algorithm as an example of a recursive sorting algorithm which can be used to put data in order (CON).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
* Students will determine the output when a recursive method is called (Skill 2.C).
* Students will determine how many times a line of code is executed in a certain method call (Skill 2.D).
* Students will explain why a given method will not execute correctly (Skill 5.B).
* Students will write a recursive method according to a given specification (Skill 3.C).
* Students will test their method with a variety of test cases (Skill 4.A).

## Assignment
* [Assignment 10: Anagrams:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit10/U10_Assignment) Students will carefully test a recursive method by writing a variety of different
test cases (Skill 4.A).

## Assessments
* Unit 10 Quiz
* Unit 10 Exam
